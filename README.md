# java_gof_singleton
a singleton design pattern in java which is also thread safe

In the example i create two class, one uses singleton, another not.

By running the main class CommandCenter, each class will be called twice.

In the debugger you can see, that the singleton class just has one same instance, 

as the other class has two instance.
